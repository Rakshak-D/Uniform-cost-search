# Delivery Route Optimization

Simulating optimal delivery route selection using Uniform Cost Search.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Delivery Route Optimization System, developed to calculate the most cost-effective path between two locations using Uniform Cost Search.

---

## 💡 Features

### User Account Management:

- Interactive source and destination input.
- Validation of graph data before computation.

### Route Optimization:

- **Direct Routes**: Identify the shortest direct path between locations.
- **Cost Optimization**: Calculates the minimal cost route.

### Comprehensive Data Handling:

- Reads and processes graph data from CSV files.
- Efficient management of route and cost information.

### Interactive User Interface:

- Intuitive prompts for seamless navigation.
- Displays optimized path and costs clearly.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Graph Data Parsing

- Loads graph data (source, destination, cost) from a CSV file.

### Priority Queue Implementation

- Manages route selection based on minimal cost using a custom priority queue.

### Uniform Cost Search Algorithm

- Efficiently finds the optimal route with cost calculations.

### Output Details

- Displays the path and total cost for selected source and destination.

## 📝 How to Run

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rakshak-D/Uniform-cost-search.git
```

### Change the directory:

```bash
cd Uniform-cost-search
```

### Compile the code:

```bash
gcc Delivery.c -o delivery
```

### Run the program:

## 📈 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter source: A
Enter destination: C
Optimal route cost from A to C: 30
Path: A -> C
```
